# 'nuocmd check server' is introduced in versions >4.1.1; this checks that the
# --api-server satisfies the following conditions:
#   1. It is ACTIVE and able to service REST requests.
#   2. It is able to ping its own advertised address, i.e. altAddr in
#      nuoadmin.conf, which is derived from the --alt-address argument of
#      'nuodocker start admin' and the NUODB_ALT_ADDRESS environment variable
#      for the nuoadmin entrypoint script.
#   3. It has the same commit index as the current Raft leader, which means
#      that its Raft state is up-to-date.
