Private NuoDB cluster metrics are available online in NuoDB Insights.
The instructions below help you determine your private login URL.

First, you need to determine the generated NuoDB Insights URL, 
there are several ways to do this. The easiest being to look at
the top of the Insights log for the `sub_id`:

  $ kubectl exec -it nuodb-insights -c insights -- bash
  # then once inside the container...
  > grep sub_id /var/log/nuodb/nuoca.log
  2019-04-10 21:10:18,011 NuoCA INFO Output Key: 'sub_id' set to Value: 'REDACTED_SUB_ID'

Another way to get your subscription ID is as follows:

  $ kubectl exec -it nuodb-insights -c insights -- nuoca check insights
  {"insights.sub.dashboard_url": "https://insights.nuodb.com/REDACTED_SUB_ID/", "insights.sub.id": "REDACTED_SUB_ID", ...}

The command above will output the `sub_id`, which becomes part of your Insights URL:

  <https://insights.nuodb.com/REDACTED_SUB_ID_HERE/>

Open your browser to the URL, substituting in your sub_id into the path, to show
live performance metrics in its Grafana dashboards.
